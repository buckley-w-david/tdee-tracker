    #         Warm-up set 1: Start with the empty bar and warm up for a few reps there.
    #         Warm-Up Set 2: 40-50% of your first set x 5 reps (if the empty bar falls into this percentage- skip this step).
    #         Warm-Up Set 3: 60-65% of your first set x 3-5 reps
    #         Warm-Up Set 4: 70-80% of your first set x 3 reps
    #         Warm-up set 5: 85-90% of your first set x 1-3 reps
    #         Warm-Up Set 6: 90-95% of your first set x 1-3 reps
    #         Start working sets!
    #       https://www.baystrength.com/calculating-warmup-sets/
    #         2 sets of 5 with the empty bar and then 3 additional warmup sets with increasing weight on the bar provide an adequate warmup
    #         At the very beginning of a lifterâ€™s linear progression, I will often have them do a set of 5 for every warmup set except for the last one, where I have them do a set of 2.
    #         method 1: even jumps - take your work weight of the day, subtract the bar (45 lbs), and then divide the difference by 4
    #         method 2: (empty bar /) 45% / 65% / 85% (/ work weight)
